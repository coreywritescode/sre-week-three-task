Prompt: 
Identify potential solutions or products, whether free or commercial, to address the toil in the ticketing system. These solutions should aim to mitigate issues such as recurring obsolete alerts and lack of prioritization. Create a markdown file and fill these solutions in your markdown file (feel free to use your repo's README.md file for this task).

Response: 
There are many systems that could be used for managing the tickets are Jira, Service Now, Guts ( wink! ;) ), Grafana or any other case/ticket management system that either has a support integration or something that is flexible enough for an API integration. If it supports alerting integrations (such as relying on paging, rather than TCP based comms traffic - this cellular network and SMS) then that will be great for higher priority mission criticla systems. If those systems have some MTTR tracking capabilities, then that will be good metric for tracking toil!
